PSSCOC Notice
(1) If the Contractor is of the opinion that the progress or completion of the Works is or will
be or has been delayed by any of the events stated in Clause 14.2, he shall forthwith notify
the Superintending Officer in writing of such event and shall in any case do so within 60
days of the occurrence of such event. If the Contractor is of the opinion that the event is
one which entitles him to an extension of time under Clause 14.2, he shall in that notice
and in any case not later than the 60 day period set out above inform the Superintending
Officer, together with the appropriate Contract references, of the reasons why there will or
may be delay to the completion of the Works or any part or section of the Works, the length
of the delay and of the extension of time required, and the effect of the event on the
programme accepted under Clause 9. Both the submission of a notice in writing and of the
further information within the 60 day period set out above shall be conditions precedent to
any entitlement to an extension of time. Subject also to compliance with Clause 14.3(2)
hereof, the Superintending Officer shall notify the Contractor in writing within 60 days of
the receipt of the notice in writing whether in his opinion the event is one which does or
might entitle the Contractor to an extension of time.
(2) If the Superintending Officer is of the opinion that the notice given by the Contractor or the
accompanying references or reasons are insufficient to enable him to decide on the
Contractor's application, the Superintending Officer may require the Contractor to provide
within 14 days or such other period as may be required by the Superintending Officer such
further particulars concerning any event and the circumstances of the delay, the measures
planned and/or taken to prevent or minimise delay and any further information which the
Superintending Officer may reasonably require.
(3) When the Superintending Officer has received sufficient information to enable him to
decide the Contractor's application, he shall, within a reasonable time, make in writing to
the Contractor such extension of time, if any, of the whole or any phase or part of the Works
(as the case may be) as may in his opinion be fair, reasonable and necessary for the
completion of the Works. The Superintending Officer shall take into account the effect, or
extent, of any work omitted under the Contract and shall also take into account whether the
event in question is one which will delay completion of the Works. The Superintending
Officer shall also take into account any delays which may operate concurrently with the
delay due to the event or events in question and which are due to acts or default on the part
of the Contractor.
(4) Provided that the Contractor shall have complied with the requirements of Clause 14.3(1),
if the Contractor shall not have provided the Superintending Officer with sufficient
information to enable him to decide the Contractor's application, the Superintending Officer
may nevertheless make in writing to the Contractor such extension of time of the whole or
any phase or part of the Works (as the case may be) as may in his opinion appear to be fair,
reasonable and necessary for completion of the Works on the information available to him,
taking into account all the matters set out in Clause 14.3(3).
(5) Provided that the Contractor shall have complied with the requirements of Clause 14.3(1),
if the Contractor is dissatisfied with any extension of time made or not made by the
Superintending Officer and shall dispute it, he shall not in any reference to the
Superintending Officer or to any arbitrator pursuant to Clause 35 or otherwise (or to any
other tribunal) claim a greater extension of time than that notified pursuant to Clause
14.3(1) or advance new or additional grounds not submitted to the Superintending Officer
before he made his decision, nor shall the Superintending Officer or the arbitrator (or any
other tribunal) in considering the dispute make a decision taking into account information
which was not available to the Superintending Officer at the time when the Superintending
Officer made his original decision to make or not to make an extension of time.
